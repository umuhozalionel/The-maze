# 2D Maze Game with SDL and Raycasting

## Introduction
Welcome to my 2D Maze Game project! This game is built using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and raycasting technology. The inspiration for this project came from my fascination with classic maze games and the technical challenge of implementing raycasting for 2D graphics.

## Project Overview
This project is a 2D maze game where players navigate through a maze using keyboard controls. The game features real-time rendering using raycasting, which creates a pseudo-3D effect. The goal is to reach the end of the maze while avoiding obstacles.

## Motivation
I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of game development and graphics programming. I wanted to challenge myself by implementing raycasting, a technique used in early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D. This project allowed me to explore SDL, improve my coding skills, and create something fun and interactive.

## Features
- **Real-time rendering**: The game uses raycasting to render the maze in real-time.
- **Keyboard controls**: Players can navigate the maze using the arrow keys.
- **Dynamic lighting**: The game features basic dynamic lighting to enhance the visual experience.
- **Collision detection**: Implemented to prevent players from walking through walls.

## Technical Details
### Raycasting Algorithm
Raycasting is a rendering technique that traces rays from the player's position to determine what they can see. Here's a brief overview of how it works in this game:
1. **Ray Generation**: Rays are cast from the player's position at different angles.
2. **Intersection Calculation**: For each ray, the algorithm calculates where it intersects with the maze walls.
3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from the player to the intersection point is calculated.
4. **Wall Projection**: Based on the distance, the algorithm projects the walls onto the screen, creating a pseudo-3D effect.

### SDL Integration
SDL is used for handling graphics, input, and audio. It provides a simple API for creating windows, rendering graphics, and capturing user input.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Raycasting Math**: Understanding and implementing the math behind raycasting was challenging. I spent a lot of time reading tutorials and experimenting with different approaches.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the game runs smoothly required optimizing the rendering loop and managing resources efficiently.
- **Collision Detection**: Implementing accurate collision detection was tricky, but I managed to get it working by refining the algorithm and testing extensively.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Adding textures to the walls and floor to improve the visual appeal.
- **AI Enemies**: Introducing AI-controlled enemies to increase the game's difficulty.
- **Level Editor**: Creating a level editor to allow players to design their own mazes.
- **Sound Effects**: Adding sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
